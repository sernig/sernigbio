### Shared Components
- **Schema**: Drizzle schema definitions with Zod validation
- **Types**: Shared TypeScript interfaces and types

## Data Flow

1. **Client-Server Communication**: RESTful API architecture with `/api` prefix
2. **State Management**: React Query handles server state caching and synchronization
3. **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod schema validation
4. **Data Persistence**: Storage interface abstracts database operations
5. **Real-time Updates**: Prepared for WebSocket integration through HTTP server setup

## External Dependencies
